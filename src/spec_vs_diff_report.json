  "summary": "CV preview markup was refactored to a more structured, resume-like layout using new CV-specific classnames and icons; global CSS was extended with a large set of CV preview component styles and some print-related hints. However, the diff does not clearly show complete print-specific rules for page margins/chrome removal, and it includes some changes that go beyond the requested CV preview/print refresh (notably global theme token changes and CV load behavior details).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Refine print-specific styling for the CV preview so the modern design renders consistently when printing (clean margins/full-page fill, high-contrast, reduced awkward page breaks, no app chrome).",
      "reason": "The diff shows some print-related classes (e.g., `print:shadow-none`, `print:border-0`) and `page-break-inside: avoid` on sections, but no explicit, verifiable `@media print` rules or margin/page-fill controls are visible in the provided truncated excerpts to confirm the full acceptance criteria (margins/page fill/chrome suppression/page-break rules).",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/cv/CVPreview.tsx (Card uses `print:shadow-none print:border-0`)",
        "frontend/src/index.css (`.cv-section { page-break-inside: avoid; }` shown; print-specific rules not visible in excerpt)"

      "description": "Global theme token overhaul in `index.css` (OKLCH variables for `:root`/`.dark`, chart colors, etc.) beyond CV preview/print refresh scope.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on modernizing the CV preview template and print styling; it does not request changing global design tokens/theme variables application-wide.",

        "frontend/src/index.css (`:root` and `.dark` large variable changes shown)"

      "description": "CV load/deserialization sets `summary` to an empty string (and initializes projects/certifications empty) even when loading saved CV, potentially altering existing load behavior.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists as non-goals: changing save/load behavior; this change is not part of styling/preview refresh and could affect what appears in the live preview after loading.",
